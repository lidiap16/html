<p><h2>Football is one of the best sports on this planet.
It consists of a ball, 22 players and a big pitch. This sport is really
fun and entertaining to watch. I chose this hobby as its my way of decompressing after school,
and its great to be able to see my friends and win cups.</h2></p>

 the efforts of English football clubs to standardize the varying sets of football rules,
 culminating in the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in London, England, in 1863.
