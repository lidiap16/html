<p><chess is one of the best sports on this planet.
It consists of figures, 2 players and a big board. This sport is really
fun and entertaining to watch. I chose this hobby as its my way of decompressing after school,
and its great to be able to see my friends and win competitions.</p>

<p> history</p>
<p>The history of chess dates back to the 6th century in India, where it originated as a game called Chaturanga. It evolved through various cultures, reaching Persia and then the Islamic world,
 before making its way to Europe by the 15th century, where the modern rules began to take shape. By the end of the 19th century, 
chess had become standardized and widely accepted, leading to its status as one of the world's most popular games today, with millions of players globally.
