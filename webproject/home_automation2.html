It consists of figures, 2 players and a big board. This sport is really
fun and entertaining to watch. I chose this hobby as its my way of decompressing after school,
and its great to be able to see my friends and win competitions.</h2></p>

 before making its way to Europe by the 15th century, where the modern rules began to take shape. By the end of the 19th century, 
chess had become standardized and widely accepted, leading to its status as one of the world's most popular games today, with millions of players globally.
